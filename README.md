EDA project

In this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project we analyze a dataset containing information about hotel bookings to gain insights and understand patterns in booking behavior.

The objective of this project is to explore the dataset, uncover trends, and answer key questions related to hotel bookings. Through EDA, we aim to identify factors that influence booking patterns and customer behavior.The dataset used for this analysis contains information about hotel bookings, including various attributes such as arrival date, booking date, room type, customer demographics, and booking status (confirmed, canceled). We aim to gain valuable insights into hotel booking patterns and customer behavior. By understanding these patterns, hotel management can make informed decisions to optimize their booking strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
